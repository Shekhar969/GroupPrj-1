# Photo Background Remover and Resizer

This is a frontend project that allows users to easily remove the background from any photo and change its size. The project leverages the Remove-bg API to achieve background removal and provides an intuitive interface for resizing images.

## Features

- **Remove Background**: Upload a .JPG image, and the background will be removed using the Remove-bg API.
- **Resize Photo**: Adjust the dimensions of the photo as needed.

## How It Works

   - Upload your .JPG image.
   - The image is sent to the Remove-bg API.
